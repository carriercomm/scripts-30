This is a collection of scripts I have collected over time.  
They are an assortment of bash, shell, and expect scripts.  
Some of them I found online, some I found on blogs, some I combined together to create one, and some I developed myself.

If you're unsure how to use these you should leave this page now.

These scripts can cause major damage to your system if used incorrectly, use at your own risk.
